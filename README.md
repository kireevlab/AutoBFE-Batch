**Installation**
1. Gaussian v16
2. AMBER v22
3. Schr√∂dinger v2024
4. GROMACS v2022
5. gmx_MMPBSA v1.6.x

## **A. Preprocessing**  
Download all compressed files and upload to the terminal, and decompressed through: `tar -zxvf filenamehere.tar.gz`

### **A1. Ligand Parameterization (Working Directory: `LigPara`)**  
1. **Generate RESP Charges and GAFF**  
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the `LigPara` folder and run:  
     ```bash
     sbatch submit_LigPara.sh PDBbind_db_ligands.sdf 0
     ```  
   - **Note:** It is recommended to group ligands with the same net charge into a single SDF file. Here, `0` represents the net charge of the system. 

### **A2. Protein Parameterization (Working Directory: `ProtPara`)**  
1. **Prepare Protein Structures**  
   - Use the **Protein Preparation Workflow** in **Maestro**.  
   - Save prepared protein structures into the `prepared_proteins/` directory.  

2. **Generate Complex Structures & Topology Files in Batch Mode**  
   - Move all newly generated sub-folders from `RESP` here.
   - Run the following command:  
     ```bash
     sbatch submit_proteintop.sh
     ```  
   - **Note:** Separate complexes **with** and **without ions** into different folders.

## **B. MD Simulation & Free Energy Calculation**  

### **B1. Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulation**  
- Move all newly generated sub-folders from `ProtPara` here.
- Submit MD simulations in batch mode on **GPU** (Working Directory: `MD`):  
  ```bash
  sbatch Gpu-submit.sh
  ```

### **B2. Free Energy Calculations**  

1. **MM/PBSA & MM/GBSA Calculations**  
   - Move all sub-folders from `MD` path to `input` here.
   - Run in batch mode on **CPU** (Working Directory: `MMPBSA`):  
     ```bash
     sbatch rmsd-mmpbsa.sh
     ```

2. **Alchemical Free Energy Calculations (FEP)**  
   - Submit Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) calculations (Working Directory: `FEP`):  
     ```bash
     sbatch FEP-submit.sh
     ```  
   - Run **BAR (Bennett Acceptance Ratio) Analysis**:  
     ```bash
     sbatch barAnalysis.sh
     ```
